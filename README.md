# Kidney-stone-detection
Kidney stones are a common disease that affects people all over the world, and many patients admit to suffering excruciating agony when they visit emergency rooms. The diagnosis of kidney stone disease involves the use of numerous imaging modalities. Computer-aided diagnostic systems are useful techniques that can be used as extra tools to assist doctors in their diagnosis. This work suggests employing the deep learning (DL) approach, which has recently made significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence, to automatically detect kidney stones (having stones or not) using coronal computed tomography (CT) scans.
This detection is constructed using the automated model, its accuracy was 99.82%.

Algorithm Used:

Several layers of a CNN are possible, and each layer trains the CNN to recognize the many aspects of an input picture. Each picture is given a filter or kernel to create an output that grows better and more clear with each layer. CNN offers features including natural language processing, picture recognition, and classification. There are procedures/steps that go into running CNN. They belong to the following categories:
•	Convolution operation
•	Pooling
•	Flattening
•	Padding
•	Fully connected layers
•	Activation function(like Relu, Softmax etc.)
•	Batch Normalization
